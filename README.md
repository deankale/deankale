- 👋 Hi, I’m @deankale
- 👀 I’m interested in Music, Technology, and creating products that inspire and entertain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make cool internet things all day long and get paid for it. I hope to one day quit my day-job and live out my life comfortably as a content creator.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web apps or music production tools (via MAX for Live or Python)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
